How to install Fino
===================


If you want to setup your Fino environment from sources, be sure your configuration meet the following requirements:

* Ant
* Apktool (http://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/)
* Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* OpenJDK
* Python 2.7


Install from sources
====================

--------------------------
Preparing your Android SDK
--------------------------

Before doing anything else, make sure you have the latest version of Android SDK. If not, you may follow these steps:

1. Go to http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and click on "Download the SDK"
2. Install the Android SDK Bundle at a specific location (i.e. /opt/android-bundle/)
3. Make sure the *sdk/platform-tools* directory is in your *PATH* environment variable
4. Make sure the *sdk/tools* directory is in your *PATH* environment variable


---------------------------
Generating a debug keystore
---------------------------

In order to sign every modified application APK (once Fino service inside), a debug keystore is required by the injector. To create this keystore, execute this command::

    mkdir -p ~/.android/
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/fino.keystore -alias finokey -storepass finopass -keypass finopass -keyalg RSA -validity 14000

.. warning::
    This keystore has to be generated for each user who will be working with the framework

.. tip::
    This step is optional, as the building scripts will check and generate it if necessary.

---------------------
Building Fino Service
---------------------

First of all, you need to compile the Fino service in order to produce an unsigned APK file that will be used later by our injector. 

Create a directory for your build::

    mkdir build
    cd build

Clone Fino Service git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/sysdream/fino.git
    cd fino

Build::

    ./build.sh


-------------------
Building Gadget app
-------------------

It is exactly the same for building Gadget app from sources.

Clone Gadget git repository::

    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/sysdream/gadget.git
    cd gadget

Build::

    ./build.sh


---------------------------------------
Installing Gadget-client (Fino console)
---------------------------------------

Eventually, clone Fino framework's git repository::

    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/sysdream/gadget-client.git
