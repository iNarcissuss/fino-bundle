Using Android application resources
===================================

In Android Application, resources are used to stored binaries, strings and images. These resources are identified by a resource id, stored in the *R* public static class.

Fino automatically maps this object and makes it available as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dir(app.R.string)
