Type mapping management

Java types are mapped to Python types in a single common repository.
New type mappings may be declared using a simple class decorator on the
declared mapped class. The most specific mapping is always picked when
the mapping definitions are ambiguous.

Types ordering when performing mapping obeys the following rules:
* standard inheritance matches type parent relation
* interface implementation is more general than the type, yet less
  general than parent types
* an interface that is explicitely implemented at multiple levels is
  considered as specific as its most specific declaration

For instance, here an inheritance pattern:

                      ..........    ...............
            .-------->. IThing .    . IOtherThing .
            |         ..........    ...............
            |              ^               ^
            |              |               |
            |     .----------------.       |
            |     | Implementation |       |
            |     |                |       |
            |     '----------------'       |
            |              ^               |
            |              |               |
            |    .-------------------.     |
            |    | MoreSpecificClass | ----'
            |    '-------------------'
            |              ^
            |              |
            |   .---------------------.
            '---| OtherImplementation |
                '---------------------'

The resolution order is: OtherImplementation, IThing, MoreSpecificClass,
IOtherTHing, Implementation.

Let's assume the following type objects are defined on the Python side:
* ThingObject is mapped to IThing
* ImplementationObject is mapped to Implementation
* MoreSpecificObject is mapped to MoreSpecificClass and inherits from
  ImplementationObject

Applying the resolution rules results in:
* An instance of MoreSpecificClass is mapped to MoreSpecificObject
* An instance of Implementation is mapped to ImplementationObject
* An instance of OtherImplementation is mapped to ThingObject
